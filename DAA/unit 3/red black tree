blanced red black tree 
not as strictly balanced as avl tree 
each node has color - red or black 
log n time complexity 

properties:
    - color can be red or black 
    - root node is black 
    - every leaf is black 
    - if red node ha 2 children, then both the children are always black. 
    - if only one child exist, it should be black 
    - for each node, any simple path from this node to its
    - newly inserted nodes are made red  

black height of this tree is the number of black nodes on a path from root to leaf. leaf  nodes are black. black height = height/2.
number of nodes from node to farthest descendant leaf is no more than twice as the numbe =r of nodes to the nearest descendant leaf.
